# AVR-atmega328p

The goal of this project is to provide a complete library for atmega328p and its peripheral devices, such as timers, ADC and SPI, also including other function chip, like nRF24L01p.
These code are based on the board of arduino nano.
Different from arduino, the board was treated as a pure atmega328p board.
Use C language to code, compile with avr-gcc, upload with avrdude and avr-objcopy.
